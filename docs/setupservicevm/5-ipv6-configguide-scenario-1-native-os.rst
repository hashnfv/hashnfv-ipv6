=========================================
Scenario 1 - Native OpenStack Environment
=========================================

Scenario 1 is the native OpenStack environment. Although the instructions are based on Liberty, they can be
applied to Kilo in the same way. Because the anti-spoofing rules of Security Group feature in OpenStack prevents
a VM from forwarding packets, we need to disable Security Group feature in the native OpenStack environment.

For exemplary purpose, we assume:

* A two-node setup of OpenStack environment is used as shown in :numref:`s1-figure1`
* The hostname of OpenStack Controller+Network+Compute Node is ``opnfv-os-controller``, and the host IP address
  is ``192.168.0.10``
* The hostname of OpenStack Compute Node is ``opnfv-os-compute``, and the host IP address is ``192.168.0.20``
* Ubuntu 14.04 or Fedora 21 is installed
* We use ``opnfv`` as username to login.
* We use ``devstack`` to install OpenStack Liberty. Please note that OpenStack Kilo can be used as well.

   Underlay Network Topology - Scenario 1

**Please NOTE that:**

* **The IP address shown in** :numref:`s1-figure1` **are for exemplary purpose.
  You need to configure your public IP address connecting to Internet according
  to your actual network infrastructure. And you need to make sure the private IP address are
  not conflicting with other subnets**.
* **Although the deployment model of single controller node is assumed, in case of HA (High Availability)
  deployment model where multiple controller nodes are used, there is no impact and the setup procedure
  is the same.**

************
Prerequisite
************

**OS-NATIVE-0**: Clone the following GitHub repository to get the configuration and metadata files

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/sridhargaddam/opnfv_os_ipv6_poc.git /opt/stack/opnfv_os_ipv6_poc

********************************
Set up OpenStack Controller Node
********************************

We assume the hostname is ``opnfv-os-controller``, and the host IP address is ``192.168.0.10``.

**OS-NATIVE-N-1**: Clone ``stable/liberty`` ``devstack`` code base.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack.git -b stable/liberty

**OS-NATIVE-N-2**: Copy ``local.conf.controller`` to ``devstack`` as ``local.conf``

.. code-block:: bash

    cp /opt/stack/opnfv_os_ipv6_poc/local.conf.controller ~/devstack/local.conf

**OS-NATIVE-N-3**: If you want to modify any ``devstack`` configuration, update ``local.conf`` now.

**OS-NATIVE-N-4**: Start the ``devstack`` installation.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/devstack
    ./stack.sh

**OS-NATIVE-N-5**: If all goes well, you should see the following output.

.. code-block:: bash

    This is your host IP address: 192.168.0.10
    This is your host IPv6 address: ::1
    Horizon is now available at http://192.168.0.10/
    Keystone is serving at http://192.168.0.10:5000/
    The default users are: admin and demo
    The password: password

*****************************
Set up OpenStack Compute Node
*****************************

We assume the hostname is ``opnfv-os-compute``, and the host IP address is ``192.168.0.20``.

**OS-NATIVE-M-1**: Clone ``stable/liberty`` ``devstack`` code base.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack.git -b stable/liberty

**OS-NATIVE-M-2**: Copy ``local.conf.compute`` to ``devstack`` as ``local.conf``

.. code-block:: bash

    cp /opt/stack/opnfv_os_ipv6_poc/local.conf.compute ~/devstack/local.conf

Please **note** that you need to change the IP address of ``SERVICE_HOST`` to point to your actual IP
address of OpenStack Controller

**OS-NATIVE-M-3**: If you want to modify any ``devstack`` configuration, update ``local.conf`` now.

**OS-NATIVE-M-4**: Start the ``devstack`` installation.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/devstack
    ./stack.sh

**OS-NATIVE-M-5**: If all goes well, you should see the following output.

.. code-block:: bash

    This is your host IP address: 192.168.0.20
    This is your host IPv6 address: ::1

**OS-NATIVE-M-6 (OPTIONAL)**: You can verify that OpenStack is set up correctly by showing hypervisor list

.. code-block:: bash

    ~/devstack$ nova hypervisor-list
    +----+------------------------------------+---------+------------+
    | ID  | Hypervisor hostname      | State  | Status  |
    +----+------------------------------------+---------+------------+
    | 1   | opnfv-os-controller      | up     | enabled |
    | 2   | opnfv-os-compute         | up     | enabled |
    +----+------------------------------------+---------+------------+

********************************************************
**Note**: Disable Security Groups in OpenStack ML2 Setup
********************************************************

Please note that Security Groups feature has been disabled automatically through ``local.conf`` configuration file
during the setup procedure of OpenStack in both Controller Node and Compute Node.

If you are an experienced user and installing OpenStack using a different installer (i.e. not with ``devstack``),
please make sure that Security Groups are disabled in the setup. You can verify that your setup has the following
configuration parameters.

**OS-NATIVE-SEC-1**: Change the settings in ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini`` as follows

.. code-block:: bash

    # /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini
    [securitygroup]
    extension_drivers = port_security
    enable_security_group = False
    firewall_driver = neutron.agent.firewall.NoopFirewallDriver

**OS-NATIVE-SEC-2**: Change the settings in ``/etc/nova/nova.conf`` as follows

.. code-block:: bash

    # /etc/nova/nova.conf
    [DEFAULT]
    security_group_api = nova
    firewall_driver = nova.virt.firewall.NoopFirewallDriver

**OS-NATIVE-SEC-3**: After updating the settings, you will have to restart the
``Neutron`` and ``Nova`` services.

**Please note that the commands of restarting** ``Neutron`` **and** ``Nova`` **would vary
depending on the installer. Please refer to relevant documentation of specific installers**

*********************************
Set Up Service VM as IPv6 vRouter
*********************************

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-1**: Now we assume that OpenStack multi-node setup is up and running.
We have to source the tenant credentials in this step. The following commands should be executed
in ``devstack``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # source the tenant credentials in devstack
    cd ~/devstack
    source openrc admin demo

Please **NOTE** that the method of sourcing tenant credentials may vary depending on installers.
**Please refer to relevant documentation of installers if you encounter any issue**.

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-2**: Download ``fedora22`` image which would be used for ``vRouter``

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/22/Cloud/x86_64/Images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-22-20150521.x86_64.qcow2

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-3**: Import Fedora22 image to ``glance``

.. code-block:: bash

    glance image-create --name 'Fedora22' --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --file ./Fedora-Cloud-Base-22-20150521.x86_64.qcow2

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-4**: Now we have to move the physical interface (i.e. the public network interface)
to ``br-ex``, including moving the public IP address and setting up default route. **Please note that this step
may already have been done when you use a different installer to deploy OpenStack because that installer
may have already moved the physical interface to** ``br-ex`` **during deployment**.

Because our ``opnfv-os-controller`` node has two interfaces ``eth0`` and ``eth1``,
and ``eth1`` is used for external connectivity, move the IP address of ``eth1`` to ``br-ex``.

Please note that the IP address ``198.59.156.113`` and related subnet and gateway addressed in the command
below are for exemplary purpose. **Please replace them with the IP addresses of your actual network**.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo ip addr del 198.59.156.113/24 dev eth1
    sudo ovs-vsctl add-port br-ex eth1
    sudo ifconfig eth1 up
    sudo ip addr add 198.59.156.113/24 dev br-ex
    sudo ifconfig br-ex up
    sudo ip route add default via 198.59.156.1 dev br-ex

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-5**: Verify that ``br-ex`` now has the original external IP address, and that the default route is on
``br-ex``

.. code-block:: bash

    opnfv@opnfv-os-controller:~/devstack$ ip a s br-ex
    38: br-ex: <BROADCAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1430 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default
        link/ether 00:50:56:82:42:d1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 198.59.156.113/24 brd 198.59.156.255 scope global br-ex
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet6 fe80::543e:28ff:fe70:4426/64 scope link
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    opnfv@opnfv-os-controller:~/devstack$
    opnfv@opnfv-os-controller:~/devstack$ ip route
    default via 198.59.156.1 dev br-ex
    192.168.0.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.0.10
    192.168.122.0/24 dev virbr0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.122.1
    198.59.156.0/24 dev br-ex  proto kernel  scope link  src 198.59.156.113

Please note that the IP addresses above are exemplary purpose.

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-6**: Create Neutron routers ``ipv4-router`` and ``ipv6-router`` which need to provide external
connectivity.

.. code-block:: bash

    neutron router-create ipv4-router
    neutron router-create ipv6-router

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-7**: Create an external network/subnet ``ext-net`` using the appropriate values based on the
data-center physical network setup.

Please **NOTE** that if you use a different installer, i.e. NOT ``devstack``, your installer
may have already created an external network during installation. Under this circumstance,
you may only need to create the subnet of ``ext-net``. When you create the subnet, you must
use the same name of external network that your installer creates.

**Please refer to the documentation of your installer if there is any issue**

.. code-block:: bash

    # If you use a different installer and it has already created an external work,
    # Please skip this command "net-create"
    neutron net-create --router:external ext-net

    # If you use a different installer and it has already created an external work,
    # Change the name "ext-net" to match the name of external network that your installer has created
    neutron subnet-create --disable-dhcp --allocation-pool start=198.59.156.251,end=198.59.156.254 --gateway 198.59.156.1 ext-net 198.59.156.0/24

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-8**: Create Neutron networks ``ipv4-int-network1`` and ``ipv6-int-network2``
with port_security disabled

.. code-block:: bash

    neutron net-create --port_security_enabled=False ipv4-int-network1
    neutron net-create --port_security_enabled=False ipv6-int-network2

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-9**: Create IPv4 subnet ``ipv4-int-subnet1`` in the internal network ``ipv4-int-network1``,
and associate it to ``ipv4-router``.

.. code-block:: bash

    neutron subnet-create --name ipv4-int-subnet1 --dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8 ipv4-int-network1 20.0.0.0/24
    neutron router-interface-add ipv4-router ipv4-int-subnet1

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-10**: Associate the ``ext-net`` to the Neutron routers ``ipv4-router`` and ``ipv6-router``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # If you use a different installer and it has already created an external work,
    # Change the name "ext-net" to match the name of external network that your installer has created
    neutron router-gateway-set ipv4-router ext-net
    neutron router-gateway-set ipv6-router ext-net

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-11**: Create two subnets, one IPv4 subnet ``ipv4-int-subnet2`` and one IPv6 subnet
``ipv6-int-subnet2`` in ``ipv6-int-network2``, and associate both subnets to ``ipv6-router``

.. code-block:: bash

    neutron subnet-create --name ipv4-int-subnet2 --dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8 ipv6-int-network2 10.0.0.0/24
    neutron subnet-create --name ipv6-int-subnet2 --ip-version 6 --ipv6-ra-mode slaac --ipv6-address-mode slaac ipv6-int-network2 2001:db8:0:1::/64
    neutron router-interface-add ipv6-router ipv4-int-subnet2
    neutron router-interface-add ipv6-router ipv6-int-subnet2

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-12**: Create a keypair

.. code-block:: bash

    nova keypair-add vRouterKey > ~/vRouterKey

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-13**: Create ports for vRouter (with some specific MAC address - basically for automation -
to know the IPv6 addresses that would be assigned to the port).

.. code-block:: bash

    neutron port-create --name eth0-vRouter --mac-address fa:16:3e:11:11:11 ipv6-int-network2
    neutron port-create --name eth1-vRouter --mac-address fa:16:3e:22:22:22 ipv4-int-network1

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-14**: Create ports for VM1 and VM2.

.. code-block:: bash

    neutron port-create --name eth0-VM1 --mac-address fa:16:3e:33:33:33 ipv4-int-network1
    neutron port-create --name eth0-VM2 --mac-address fa:16:3e:44:44:44 ipv4-int-network1

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-15**: Update ``ipv6-router`` with routing information to subnet ``2001:db8:0:2::/64``

.. code-block:: bash

    neutron router-update ipv6-router --routes type=dict list=true destination=2001:db8:0:2::/64,nexthop=2001:db8:0:1:f816:3eff:fe11:1111

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-16**: Boot Service VM (``vRouter``), VM1 and VM2

.. code-block:: bash

    nova boot --image Fedora22 --flavor m1.small --user-data /opt/stack/opnfv_os_ipv6_poc/metadata.txt --availability-zone nova:opnfv-os-compute --nic port-id=$(neutron port-list | grep -w eth0-vRouter | awk '{print $2}') --nic port-id=$(neutron port-list | grep -w eth1-vRouter | awk '{print $2}') --key-name vRouterKey vRouter
    nova list
    nova console-log vRouter #Please wait for some 10 to 15 minutes so that necessary packages (like radvd) are installed and vRouter is up.
    nova boot --image cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-uec --flavor m1.tiny --nic port-id=$(neutron port-list | grep -w eth0-VM1 | awk '{print $2}') --availability-zone nova:opnfv-os-controller --key-name vRouterKey --user-data /opt/stack/opnfv_os_ipv6_poc/set_mtu.sh VM1
    nova boot --image cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-uec --flavor m1.tiny --nic port-id=$(neutron port-list | grep -w eth0-VM2 | awk '{print $2}') --availability-zone nova:opnfv-os-compute --key-name vRouterKey --user-data /opt/stack/opnfv_os_ipv6_poc/set_mtu.sh VM2
    nova list # Verify that all the VMs are in ACTIVE state.

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-17**: If all goes well, the IPv6 addresses assigned to the VMs would be as shown as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    vRouter eth0 interface would have the following IPv6 address: 2001:db8:0:1:f816:3eff:fe11:1111/64
    vRouter eth1 interface would have the following IPv6 address: 2001:db8:0:2::1/64
    VM1 would have the following IPv6 address: 2001:db8:0:2:f816:3eff:fe33:3333/64
    VM2 would have the following IPv6 address: 2001:db8:0:2:f816:3eff:fe44:4444/64

**OS-NATIVE-SETUP-18**: Now we can ``SSH`` to VMs. You can execute the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

    # 1. Create a floatingip and associate it with VM1, VM2 and vRouter (to the port id that is passed).
    #    If you use a different installer and it has already created an external work,
    #    Change the name "ext-net" to match the name of external network that your installer has created
    neutron floatingip-create --port-id $(neutron port-list | grep -w eth0-VM1 | \
    awk '{print $2}') ext-net
    neutron floatingip-create --port-id $(neutron port-list | grep -w eth0-VM2 | \
    awk '{print $2}') ext-net
    neutron floatingip-create --port-id $(neutron port-list | grep -w eth1-vRouter | \
    awk '{print $2}') ext-net

    # 2. To know / display the floatingip associated with VM1, VM2 and vRouter.
    neutron floatingip-list -F floating_ip_address -F port_id | grep $(neutron port-list | \
    grep -w eth0-VM1 | awk '{print $2}') | awk '{print $2}'
    neutron floatingip-list -F floating_ip_address -F port_id | grep $(neutron port-list | \
    grep -w eth0-VM2 | awk '{print $2}') | awk '{print $2}'
    neutron floatingip-list -F floating_ip_address -F port_id | grep $(neutron port-list | \
    grep -w eth1-vRouter | awk '{print $2}') | awk '{print $2}'

    # 3. To ssh to the vRouter, VM1 and VM2, user can execute the following command.
    ssh -i ~/vRouterKey fedora@<floating-ip-of-vRouter>
    ssh -i ~/vRouterKey cirros@<floating-ip-of-VM1>
    ssh -i ~/vRouterKey cirros@<floating-ip-of-VM2>
