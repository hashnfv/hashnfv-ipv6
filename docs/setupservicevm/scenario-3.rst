Scenario 3 - OpenStack + Open Daylight Lithium with Patch of Bug Fix
===============================================================

Scenario 3 is the environment of OpenStack + Open Daylight Lithium,
which is similar to Scenario 2. However, we use an Open Daylight Lithium
controller which is built from the latest stable/Lithium branch that includes the fix of a bug.
In this scenario, we can fully automate the setup similar to Scenario 1.
