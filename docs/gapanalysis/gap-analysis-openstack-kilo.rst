IPv6 Gap Analysis with OpenStack Kilo
=====================================

This section provides users with IPv6 gap analysis regarding feature requirement with
OpenStack Neutron in Kilo Official Release. The following table lists the use cases / feature
requirements of VIM-agnostic IPv6 functionality, including infrastructure layer and VNF
(VM) layer, and its gap analysis with OpenStack Neutron in Kilo Official Release.
